Medical Data Analytics â€” Predicting Disease Outcomes Using Machine Learning
ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project focuses on the application of data analytics and machine learning in healthcare, aiming to predict disease risks and patient outcomes using synthetic medical data (no external files required).

The project simulates real-world medical datasets containing patient health indicators such as age, blood pressure, glucose level, BMI, and cholesterol, then applies exploratory analysis and predictive modeling to gain insights into disease patterns.

This major project demonstrates the power of AI-driven healthcare analytics for early diagnosis and prevention.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Generate and analyze synthetic patient health data

Visualize medical parameters and their correlation with disease risk

Build a machine learning model to predict disease probability

Derive actionable insights for healthcare improvements

ðŸ§  Key Insights

High blood pressure and glucose levels are strong predictors of chronic disease

Females aged 40â€“55 show higher likelihood of diabetes risk in this dataset

Random Forest model achieved over 90% accuracy in disease prediction

Correlation heatmaps reveal strong patterns between BMI, glucose, and risk score
